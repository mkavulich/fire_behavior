UFS Short-Range Weather Application (SRW)
=========================================

The CFBM has been coupled to the UFS Weather Model for both one-way (atmosphere -> fire) and two-way coupled simulations.
Simulations can be run using the UFS Short-Range Weather Application (SRW), a community-supported application for running
numerical weather prediction simulations on limited-area domains. For information on using this capability, see
`the SRW Users Guide <https://ufs-srweather-app--1139.org.readthedocs.build/en/1139/UsersGuide/BuildingRunningTesting/FIRE.html>`_.

A preprint on scientific results using this new UFS Fire capability is available (:cite:`CFBM`).
